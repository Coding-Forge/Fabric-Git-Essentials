# Fabric + Git Essentials Workshop

> **Version:** 1.1 &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Author:** Brandon Campbell &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Updated:** June 2026

A hands-on workshop covering Git integration, CI/CD automation, and deployment best practices for **Microsoft Fabric** and **Power BI** (PBIP format).

This README provides a **topic-by-topic index** of supporting resources, architecture docs, lab guides, and reference materials used throughout the workshop.

> PBIP artifacts are intentionally **not committed** in this repository. Bring your own PBIP files locally under `projects/` (or `projects/pbip-local/`) and keep reusable CI/CD assets (`Rules-*.json`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `azure-pipelines.yml`) in source control.
>
> This repo now also includes a reusable **universal Fabric CI/CD pipeline** under `projects/universal-pipeline/`. The intent is to host one shared template repo for Fabric artifact validation/deployment, while each project repo keeps only a small consumer `azure-pipelines.yml`.

### CI/CD Pipeline Options
- Use [projects/azure-pipelines.yml](projects/azure-pipelines.yml) for the workshop's PBIP-specific Azure DevOps CI/CD walkthrough. It validates, tests, publishes `pbip-drop`, then deploys to Dev or feature workspaces with [projects/scripts/deploy-dynamic.ps1](projects/scripts/deploy-dynamic.ps1).
- Use [projects/universal-pipeline/README.md](projects/universal-pipeline/README.md) when you want one shared Azure DevOps template repo that can be consumed by many Fabric project repos.
- Use [.github/workflows/powerbi-ci.yml](.github/workflows/powerbi-ci.yml) for GitHub Actions-based PBIP validation in GitHub-hosted repos.
- Use [.github/README.md](.github/README.md) for a dedicated GitHub project setup guide.

### GitHub Actions CI (Power BI)

The GitHub Actions workflow at [.github/workflows/powerbi-ci.yml](.github/workflows/powerbi-ci.yml) mirrors the workshop CI pattern: Validate -> Quality Rules -> DAX Tests -> Publish Artifacts.

Required repository structure:

```text
repo-root/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── powerbi-ci.yml
└── projects/
    ├── pbip-local/                  # local PBIP artifacts used by CI checks
    ├── Rules-Dataset.json           # optional; fallback downloaded if missing
    ├── Rules-Report.json            # optional; fallback downloaded if missing
    ├── scripts/
    │   └── Prepare-QualityRules.ps1
    └── tests/
        ├── validate_pbip_structure.py
        └── run_dax_tests.py
```

Skip controls (similar to universal Azure template behavior):
- Manual run inputs in GitHub Actions: `skip_dataset_rules`, `skip_report_rules`, `skip_dax_tests`, `skip_publish`.
- Optional repository/org variables for default behavior on all runs:
  - `PBIP_CI_SKIP_DATASET_RULES`
  - `PBIP_CI_SKIP_REPORT_RULES`
  - `PBIP_CI_SKIP_DAX_TESTS`
  - `PBIP_CI_SKIP_PUBLISH`

Set variable values to `true` or `false`.

Branch policy behavior:
- The workflow triggers on `main`, `feature/*`, and pull requests targeting `main`.
- Branch-aware severity handling is applied by [projects/scripts/Prepare-QualityRules.ps1](projects/scripts/Prepare-QualityRules.ps1):
  - Dataset rules enforce severity >= 2 on protected target branches such as `main` and `develop`, and >= 3 on feature branches.
  - Report rules keep selected checks as warnings on feature branches, and promote those checks to errors on protected target branches.

This pattern keeps feature-branch feedback fast while preserving stricter enforcement for protected integration branches.

# 3. Best Practices Summary

### Governance
- Enforce workspace separation  
- Require PR-based development  
- Centralize RLS/CLS rules  
- Standardize naming conventions  

### Git Integration
- Keep branches small  
- Protect `main`  
- Use Workspace → Git sync workflows  

### CI/CD
- Automate schema validation  
- Publish validated PBIP artifacts from the YAML pipeline  
- Deploy `main` and `develop` to Dev, and `feature/*` branches to isolated feature workspaces  
- Treat PBIP artifacts as code  
- Use service principals and secured variable groups or Key Vault-linked variable groups for deployment secrets  

### Embedded Analytics
- Prefer **App Owns Data** for external apps  
- Use service principals exclusively  
- Validate RLS interactions with embedding

# 4. Contributing

Contributions are welcome when they improve the workshop, clarify the learning path, or make the examples easier to adapt in real Fabric and Power BI environments.

Suggested contribution workflow:

1. Create a short-lived branch such as `feature/<alias>-<change>` or `docs/<alias>-<topic>`.
2. Keep changes focused on one topic, lab, script, or pipeline behavior.
3. Update related documentation when changing YAML, PowerShell, tests, rules, or workshop flow.
4. Run the relevant local checks before opening a pull request. For PBIP validation changes, start with [projects/tests/validate_pbip_structure.py](projects/tests/validate_pbip_structure.py) and the quality-rule preparation script.
5. Open a pull request with a clear summary, testing notes, and any environment assumptions.

Good contributions include documentation fixes, clearer lab steps, safer validation rules, reusable pipeline improvements, and examples that help teams adapt the workshop to their own Fabric tenant. Avoid committing tenant-specific IDs, client secrets, tokens, real customer data, exported PBIP files that should remain local, or environment-specific values that belong in variable groups or secure configuration.

# 5. Disclaimer

This repository contains workshop material and example automation code. The YAML pipelines, PowerShell scripts, validation rules, tests, and deployment examples are provided as reference implementations and starting points only.

You are responsible for validating permissions, service principal configuration, secrets handling, Fabric tenant settings, API behavior, and deployment outcomes in your environment.
