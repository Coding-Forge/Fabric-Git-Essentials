# Fabric BI DevOps Accelerator Tools

This repository includes a no-code browser toolkit that helps teams turn enterprise Power BI standards, PBIP review, CI/CD setup, release readiness, governance, and adoption tracking into source-controllable artifacts without asking report authors to hand-edit JSON.

Use these tools to support:

- Enterprise Power BI onboarding
- Governance workshops
- Report factory enablement
- Pull request quality standards
- Reusable policy profiles for departments, domains, or solution teams

## Value Proposition

Enterprise Power BI quality standards often fail when they live only in documents. These tools make standards actionable by converting policy decisions into the same rule files used by the pipeline:

- `shared/Rules-Report.json` for PBI Inspector report checks
- `shared/Rules-Dataset.json` for Tabular Editor BPA dataset checks
- `shared/dax-tests.json` for measure-level DAX validation scenarios consumed by the DAX test runner

The result is a governance workflow that is easier to explain, easier to adopt, and easier to enforce through Git-based delivery across report checks, semantic model checks, and DAX test coverage.

## Enterprise Standards Builder

Open:

```text
tools/enterprise-standards-builder/index.html
```

The Enterprise Standards Builder is the recommended starting point for most teams. It lets users choose a governance posture, adjust policy controls, and generate pipeline-ready quality rules.

![Enterprise Standards Builder](../../images/Enterprise-standards-builder.png)

### Capabilities: Read & Update Only

The Enterprise Standards Builder provides **read and update operations** on pre-defined policies:

- ✅ **Read**: Load and view existing governance policies
- ✅ **Update**: Modify parameters of existing policies (e.g., adjust max visuals from 12 to 15)
- ❌ **Create**: Cannot create new policies from scratch
- ❌ **Delete**: Cannot remove policies
- ❌ **Advanced editing**: No JSON editing capability

### What It Helps Users Do

- Choose a policy profile: **Advisory adoption**, **Enterprise standard**, **Strict enterprise gate**, or **Custom**
- Configure report usability standards such as page count, visual density, page names, and vertical scrolling
- Configure visual standards such as theme colors and axis titles
- Configure semantic model and DAX standards such as format strings, safe division, hidden foreign keys, and relationship data types
- Preserve custom rules already present in existing rule files
- Export an auditable policy profile and summary for review

### Best Fit

Use this tool when the conversation starts with questions like:

- "What should our enterprise Power BI standard be?"
- "How strict should our CI checks be?"
- "How do we make report teams follow governance policies?"
- "How do we generate baseline rules for a new solution?"

## Quality Rule Designer

Open:

```text
tools/rule-designer/index.html
```

The Quality Rule Designer is the advanced companion tool for rule authorship and maintenance. It is useful when a team needs to create new rules, modify existing rules, or inspect and debug the generated JSON.

### Capabilities: Full CRUD Operations

The Quality Rule Designer provides **complete rule management** with full Create, Read, Update, Delete capabilities:

- ✅ **Create**: Build new rules from scratch using templates or custom JSON logic
- ✅ **Read**: Load and inspect existing `Rules-Report.json` and `Rules-Dataset.json` files
- ✅ **Update**: Modify rule parameters, logic, and settings
- ✅ **Delete**: Remove rules from your rule set
- ✅ **Advanced editing**: Edit raw JSON logic and customize rule templates

### What It Helps Users Do

- Load existing `Rules-Report.json` and `Rules-Dataset.json` files
- Create report rules from guided templates
- Create dataset rules from Tabular Editor BPA templates
- Create custom PBI Inspector report rules
- Create custom Tabular Editor BPA dataset rules
- Preview generated JSON and diffs before download
- Preview PBIP report folder structure for page and visual counts

### Best Fit

Use this tool when the conversation starts with questions like:

- "Can we tune this one rule?"
- "Can we add a custom report check?"
- "Why is this rule failing?"
- "Can we lower the severity while the team cleans up violations?"
- "Can we build a rule that doesn't fit the preset templates?"

## DAX Test Builder

Open:

```text
tools/dax-test-builder/index.html
```

The DAX Test Builder captures measure-level validation scenarios in a structured `dax-tests.json` file. A starter catalog is available at `shared/dax-tests.json` with generally accepted DAX test patterns such as non-blank critical measures, non-negative totals, percentage ranges, reconciliation checks, time-intelligence sanity checks, and no-data slice behavior. The repository DAX runner reads this catalog, validates enabled test metadata, and emits JUnit results. Actual DAX query execution is still represented as skipped until semantic-link-labs, XMLA, or Tabular Editor scripting is wired in.

![DAX Test Builder](../../images/dax-test-builder.png)

The starter tests are disabled by default because every semantic model has different measure names, table names, filter contexts, and expected values. Teams should customize and enable them as part of model onboarding.

### What It Helps Users Do

- Define measure test cases with owner, scenario, filter context, expected result, assertion type, severity, and tags
- Generate a DAX query preview for each test case
- Bulk import simple test shells from CSV
- Load and customize the starter `shared/dax-tests.json` catalog
- Export `dax-tests.json` for future CI integration
- Export a Markdown test catalog for PR and governance review

### Best Fit

Use this tool when the conversation starts with questions like:

- "What measure outcomes should we validate before release?"
- "Can we define DAX unit tests without editing Python?"
- "Can we document test coverage for certified semantic models?"
- "Can we make DAX validation portable across Azure DevOps, GitHub, and GitLab?"

## Deployment Manifest Builder

Open:

```text
tools/deployment-manifest-builder/index.html
```

The Deployment Manifest Builder creates a readable deployment contract for a PBIP solution. It can scan an existing PBIP folder to infer a starter manifest from the `.pbip`, `.Report`, `.SemanticModel`, rule, DAX test, and exception files, then lets users complete the business ownership and environment details. It helps users understand the business purpose, owners, artifacts, Dev/Test/Prod workspaces, environment-specific parameters, validation gates, approvals, rollback plan, and known exceptions.

![Deployment Manifest Builder](../../images/deployment-manifest-builder.png)

### What It Helps Users Do

- Explain what the PBIP solution is and who owns it
- Scan an existing PBIP folder and infer a draft manifest
- List the PBIP, report, semantic model, quality rule, and DAX test assets
- Map Dev/Test/Prod workspaces and connection profiles
- Document parameters that change by environment
- Capture required validation gates and approvals
- Export `deployment-manifest.json` and a Markdown summary for PR or release review

### Best Fit

Use this tool when the conversation starts with questions like:

- "Where does this PBIP solution deploy?"
- "What changes between Dev, Test, and Prod?"
- "Who approves production promotion?"
- "What is the rollback plan?"

## PBIP Project Readiness Scanner

Open:

```text
tools/pbip-readiness-scanner/index.html
```

The PBIP Project Readiness Scanner checks a local repository or PBIP project folder before a pull request. It runs entirely in the browser and does not upload files anywhere.

![PBIP Project Readiness Scanner](../../images/pbip-project-readiness-scanner.png)

### What It Helps Users Do

- Confirm exactly one `.pbip` file is present
- Detect `.Report` and `.SemanticModel` folders
- Validate key report and semantic model references such as `definition.pbir`, `definition/report.json`, `definition.pbism`, and `definition/model.tmdl`
- Check for governance assets such as `Rules-Report.json`, `Rules-Dataset.json`, `dax-tests.json`, policy profiles, and exception registers
- Check for Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI pipeline files
- Export a Markdown PR-readiness report and a machine-readable JSON report

### Best Fit

Use this tool when the conversation starts with questions like:

- "Is this PBIP project ready for PR?"
- "What is missing before CI runs?"
- "Can a report author self-check before pushing?"
- "Do we have the governance and pipeline assets wired up?"

## PBIP Diff Viewer

Open:

```text
tools/pbip-diff-viewer/index.html
```

The PBIP Diff Viewer compares before and after PBIP snapshots and translates raw report, semantic model, rule, test, exception, manifest, and pipeline metadata changes into reviewer-friendly guidance.

![PBIP Diff Viewer](../../images/pbip-diff-viewer.png)

### Understanding Before and After Snapshots

The tool requires two PBIP folder snapshots representing different states:
- **Before folder**: Original PBIP state (from parent branch like main or develop)
- **After folder**: Modified PBIP state (from feature branch with your changes)

Obtain these by:
1. Checking out the parent branch and exporting the PBIP folder from your workspace
2. Checking out your feature branch and exporting the PBIP folder again
3. Loading both folders into the tool for comparison

### What It Helps Users Do

- Compare two local PBIP or repository snapshots without uploading files.
- Classify added, removed, and changed report, model, rule, DAX test, exception, manifest, and pipeline files.
- Filter changes by artifact type or path.
- Export HTML, Markdown, and JSON diff reports for pull request review.

### Best Fit

Use this tool when the conversation starts with questions like:

- "What changed between these two PBIP snapshots?"
- "What should reviewers focus on instead of raw JSON?"
- "Were any model or report files removed?"
- "Can we attach a readable diff report to the PR?"

## Dependency Impact Analyzer

Open:

```text
tools/dependency-impact-analyzer/index.html
```

The Dependency Impact Analyzer scans PBIP report and semantic model metadata to trace changed model objects to impacted measures, relationships, visuals, report pages, tests, deployment manifests, and governance assets.

![Dependency Impact Analyzer](../../images/dependency-impact-analyzer.png)

### What It Helps Users Do

- Enter changed model objects such as `Revenue`, `Sales[Amount]`, or `Customer[Region]`.
- Identify measures and relationships that reference changed objects.
- Find report visuals and pages that may need regression review.
- Export HTML, Markdown, and JSON impact reports for PR and release review.

### Best Fit

Use this tool when the conversation starts with questions like:

- "If this measure changes, which reports might be affected?"
- "Which visuals reference this column?"
- "What should we regression test before approving the PR?"
- "Which governance assets mention this object?"

## Pipeline Config Generator

Open:

```text
tools/pipeline-config-generator/index.html
```

The Pipeline Config Generator creates Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI YAML from one PBIP delivery profile, including validation, quality rules, DAX test metadata, artifact publishing, deployment, runner guidance, and required secrets.

![Pipeline Config Generator](../../images/pipeline-config-generator.png)

### What It Helps Users Do

- Generate platform-specific CI/CD YAML from one profile.
- Choose validation, dataset quality, report quality, DAX test, publish, and deploy stages.
- Capture branch triggers, PBIP paths, Python version, and deployment script path.
- Export pipeline YAML, `pipeline-profile.json`, and `pipeline-setup-notes.md`.

### Best Fit

Use this tool when the conversation starts with questions like:

- "What YAML should this PBIP repo use?"
- "Which jobs need Windows runners?"
- "Which secrets are required for deployment?"
- "Can we generate equivalent setup for Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, and GitLab?"

## Marketing Positioning

Use the following summary in presentations, internal announcements, or workshop collateral:

> The Fabric BI DevOps Accelerator turns standards into action. Instead of asking report creators to read policy documents and hand-edit JSON, teams can choose enterprise-ready settings in a browser, generate the exact rule files used by CI/CD, and enforce consistent report and semantic model quality through Git-based delivery.

## Suggested Demo Flow

1. Open the Enterprise Standards Builder.
2. Switch between **Advisory**, **Enterprise standard**, and **Strict** profiles to show how enforcement changes.
3. Adjust a visible setting such as maximum report pages or maximum visuals per page.
4. Show the generated report and dataset JSON.
5. Download the policy summary and explain how it can be attached to a PR or governance review.
6. Open the Quality Rule Designer and show how an advanced user can tune one rule.
7. Open the DAX Test Builder and show how a semantic model owner can define a critical measure test.
8. Open the Deployment Manifest Builder and show the Dev/Test/Prod deployment contract.
9. Open the PBIP Project Readiness Scanner and show the PR-ready Markdown report.
