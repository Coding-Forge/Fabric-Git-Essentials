# Lab 1 — Connect a Fabric Workspace to Git

## Overview

In this lab you will connect a Microsoft Fabric workspace to a Git repository hosted in **Azure DevOps** or **GitHub**. You will perform an initial sync, create a feature branch, make a small change to a report, and submit a pull request back to `main`.

By the end of the lab your workspace will be under full source control and every future change will be tracked as a Git commit.

---

## Objectives

1. Enable and configure **Git integration** on a Fabric workspace  
2. Perform the initial **workspace → repo sync**  
3. Create a **feature branch** from `main`  
4. Make a report or semantic model change  
5. Commit and push the change  
6. Use accelerator tools to scan readiness and prepare a reviewer handoff  
7. Open a **pull request**, request a review, and merge  

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Fabric workspace | Capacity-backed (F2 or higher); you need **Contributor** or higher role |
| Git repo | An Azure DevOps project **or** a GitHub repository you can push to |
| Permissions | Ability to create branches and open PRs in the repo |
| Fabric admin toggle | **Users can synchronize workspace items with their Git repositories** — must be enabled in the Fabric Admin portal |
| Authentication | OAuth (default) **or** a Personal Access Token (PAT) scoped to `Code (Read & Write)` |
| Sample project | PBIP starter project cloned locally (provided by facilitator) |
| Accelerator tools | Local browser access to `tools/index.html` |

> If you do not have a customer PBIP solution, build one from the synthetic [DIB Supply Chain sample data](../../sample-data/dib-supply-chain/README.md) using the [PBIP Build Guide](../../sample-data/dib-supply-chain/pbip-build-guide.md).

---

## Part 1 — Enable Git Integration on Your Workspace

### 1.1 Open Workspace Settings

1. Navigate to your assigned **Dev workspace** in the Microsoft Fabric portal.  
2. Click the **ellipsis (…)** next to the workspace name in the left nav, then choose **Workspace settings**.  
3. Select the **Git integration** tab.

### 1.2 Connect to Your Git Provider

1. Under **Connect to Git**, choose your provider:
   - **Azure DevOps** — or —  
   - **GitHub**

2. Sign in with your organizational account when prompted.

3. Fill in the connection fields:

   | Field | Value |
   |---|---|
   | Organization | Your Azure DevOps org **or** GitHub org/user |
   | Project | *(Azure DevOps only)* Your project name |
   | Repository | The repo designated for this workshop |
   | Branch | `main` |
   | Folder path | `/projects` *(or as directed by facilitator)* |

4. Click **Connect and sync**.

> **Tip:** If OAuth is blocked by a Conditional Access policy, generate a PAT in Azure DevOps under **User Settings → Personal Access Tokens** with `Code (Read & Write)` scope and paste it when prompted.

---

## Part 2 — Verify the Initial Sync

After connecting, Fabric performs an initial synchronization and exports all workspace items as text-based PBIP artifacts to the configured repo folder.

### 2.1 Confirm Git Status in Fabric

1. Return to the workspace view.  
2. Each item (reports, semantic models, dataflows) now shows a **Git status badge** — look for a green check ✔ (synced) or an orange indicator (uncommitted changes).  
3. All badges should show **Synced** at this point.

### 2.2 Confirm Artifacts in the Repo

1. Open your repo in Azure DevOps or GitHub.  
2. Navigate to the folder path you specified (e.g., `/projects`).  
3. Verify the PBIP folder structure exists:

```
shared/
   <your-project>.pbip
   <your-project>.Report/
      definition.pbir
      definition/report.json
   <your-project>.SemanticModel/
      definition.pbism
      definition/model.tmdl
```

---

## Part 2b — Accelerator Checkpoint: Scan PBIP Readiness

Before making a feature change, use the accelerator to confirm the exported PBIP structure is ready for source-controlled review.

### 2b.1 Open the PBIP Project Readiness Scanner

1. Open:

   ```text
   tools/pbip-readiness-scanner/index.html
   ```

2. Select the repo folder that contains the synced PBIP artifacts.
3. Confirm the scanner finds:

   - One `.pbip` project file
   - `.Report` and `.SemanticModel` folders
   - Required definition files
   - Quality rule files if available
   - DAX test metadata if available
   - Pipeline files if available

4. Export the readiness output as:

   ```text
   PBIP-Readiness-Report.md
   pbip-readiness-report.json
   ```

### 2b.2 Record readiness findings

Add a short note to your lab working folder:

```text
Initial PBIP readiness:
- Structure:
- Governance assets:
- Pipeline assets:
- Warnings or blockers:
```

This gives reviewers a baseline before you make a change.

---

## Part 3 — Create a Feature Branch

Working directly on `main` is prohibited by branch policy. All changes must go through a short-lived feature branch.

### 3.1 Create the Branch in Your Git Provider

**Azure DevOps:**
1. Go to **Repos → Branches**.  
2. Click **New branch**.  
3. Name it `feature/<your-alias>-lab1` (e.g., `feature/bcampbell-lab1`).  
4. Base it on `main`.  
5. Click **Create**.

**GitHub:**
1. Go to the repository and open the **Branch** drop-down.  
2. Type `feature/<your-alias>-lab1` and click **Create branch**.

### 3.2 Switch the Workspace to Your Feature Branch

1. Back in the Fabric workspace, open **Workspace settings → Git integration**.  
2. Under **Branch**, click **Switch branch** (or **Checkout branch**).  
3. Select your newly created `feature/<your-alias>-lab1` branch.  
4. Click **Update**.

Fabric re-syncs the workspace to your feature branch. The status bar at the top of the workspace now shows your branch name.

---

## Part 4 — Make a Change

### 4.1 Edit a Report in the Fabric Portal

1. Open **SalesReport** (or the report provided by the facilitator).  
2. Add a new **text box** to the first page with the text: `Updated by <your name> — Lab 1`.  
3. Save the report (**Ctrl + S** or the Save button).

### 4.2 Review Uncommitted Changes

1. In the workspace view, the report item now shows a **pencil / modified** Git badge.  
2. Click **Source control** (the Git icon in the top-right corner of the portal) to open the **Pending changes** panel.  
3. Verify your change appears in the diff.

### 4.2b Accelerator Checkpoint: Compare the PBIP Change

If you have a local copy of the repo before and after your change, use the PBIP Diff Viewer to create a reviewer-friendly diff.

To do this:
1. Checkout your **parent branch** (develop) and export the PBIP folder from your workspace
2. Checkout your **feature branch** and export the PBIP folder again
3. Open:

   ```text
   tools/pbip-diff-viewer/index.html
   ```

4. Load the **before folder** (from develop) and **after folder** (from your feature branch).
5. Confirm the changed report metadata appears as a report/page/visual change.
6. Export:

   ```text
   pbip-diff-report.md
   pbip-diff-report.json
   ```

If you do not have two local snapshots, write a short PR note explaining what changed in the Fabric portal and continue to Part 5.

### 4.3 Commit and Push

1. In the **Pending changes** panel:
   - Provide a **commit message**: `feat: add lab1 text box to SalesReport`  
   - Leave all changed items checked.  
2. Click **Commit**.  
3. Fabric commits the change to your feature branch in the remote repo.

---

## Part 5 — Open a Pull Request

### 5.1 Create the PR

**Azure DevOps:**
1. Go to **Repos → Pull Requests → New pull request**.  
2. Set **Source** = `feature/<your-alias>-lab1` and **Target** = `main`.  
3. Add a meaningful title: `[Lab 1] Add lab1 text box to SalesReport`.  
4. Add a description, link any work items if applicable.  
5. If you generated readiness or diff output, summarize it in the PR body.  
6. Add at least one reviewer (your lab partner or the facilitator).  
7. Click **Create**.

**GitHub:**
1. Navigate to the repository and click **Compare & pull request** when the branch prompt appears.  
2. Set the base to `main` and the compare to your feature branch.  
3. Fill in the title and description, assign a reviewer.  
4. If you generated readiness or diff output, summarize it in the PR body.  
5. Click **Create pull request**.

### 5.1b Accelerator Checkpoint: Generate a PR Summary

For a more complete handoff, use the PR Quality Summary Generator.

1. Open:

   ```text
   tools/pr-quality-summary-generator/index.html
   ```

2. Paste:

   - Changed paths from the PR
   - PBIP readiness output
   - PBIP diff output, if available
   - Any reviewer notes

3. Generate Markdown and paste it into the PR description or a PR comment.

### 5.2 Review and Merge

1. The reviewer approves the PR.  
2. Confirm branch policies (if configured) pass — e.g., status checks, required reviewers.  
3. Click **Complete / Merge pull request** using **Squash merge** (recommended).  
4. Delete the feature branch after merge.

### 5.3 Sync Fabric Workspace Back to `main`

1. In Workspace settings → Git integration, switch the branch back to `main`.  
2. Click **Update**.  
3. Confirm all items show **Synced** status.

## Validation Checklist

Use this checklist to confirm you have completed the lab successfully:

- [ ] Workspace is connected to the Git repo and shows Git status badges  
- [ ] Initial sync completed — PBIP artifacts are visible in the repo  
- [ ] PBIP Readiness Scanner was run against the synced artifact folder  
- [ ] Feature branch created and workspace switched to it  
- [ ] A change was made, committed, and pushed from the Fabric portal  
- [ ] PR includes readiness and/or diff context for reviewers  
- [ ] Pull request opened with a reviewer assigned  
- [ ] PR approved and merged to `main`  
- [ ] Workspace switched back to `main` and shows **Synced**  

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Resolution |
|---|---|
| "Git integration not available" in settings | Confirm the Fabric admin toggle is enabled for your tenant. Contact your Fabric Admin. |
| OAuth sign-in fails | Use a PAT instead. Scope: `Code (Read & Write)`, expiry ≥ workshop date. |
| Items show "Conflict" status | Another team member may have pushed a change. Pull the latest, resolve conflicts in the portal, then recommit. |
| Repo folder appears empty after sync | Check that the folder path is correct and has no leading slash issues. Re-attempt sync. |
| Branch switch fails | Ensure you have at least **Contributor** role on the workspace and **Write** access to the repo. |

## Extension — Branch-Out Strategy (Personal Feature Workspace)

In this lab you connected a workspace to `main` and switched it to a feature branch. In real team development, the recommended pattern goes one step further: each feature branch gets its own **dedicated personal workspace** — you never work directly in the shared team workspace.

### Why branch out?

- Your in-progress work (broken measures, experimental layouts) is invisible to teammates in the shared workspace  
- You can iterate freely without risk of disrupting others  
- Reviewers can connect to your feature workspace to see live rendered reports, not just file diffs  
- Deleting the feature workspace and branch is a complete, clean rollback  

### How to set up a personal feature workspace

1. Click **+ New workspace** in the Fabric portal left nav.  
2. Name it `WS-Dev-<your-alias>` (e.g., `WS-Dev-bcampbell`).  
3. Assign it to the same Fabric capacity as the shared team workspace.  
4. Go to **Workspace settings → Git integration** and connect it to the same repo — but set the **Branch** to your feature branch, not `main`.  
5. Click **Connect and sync**. The workspace loads from your feature branch.  
6. Work in this personal workspace for the duration of the feature.  
7. After your PR merges, **delete this workspace** — its branch is gone and so is the workspace.

For the complete workflow, topology diagrams, naming conventions, and anti-patterns, see the [Branching Strategy](../../../architecture/branching-strategy.md) architecture document.
