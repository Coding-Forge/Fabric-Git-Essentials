# Workshop Catalog

This folder is the canonical home for workshop material in **Enterprise BI DevOps with Microsoft Fabric**.

The previous `docs/workshop-plan/` folder is retained only as a compatibility redirect for older links. New workshop content should be added under this `docs/workshops/` catalog.

## Workshop setup

For the fastest workshop setup, use the sparse clone tooling documented in the [Sparse Clone Guide](../sparse-clone-guide.md).

### Option 1 — Use the sparse clone UI

From the repository root, run:

```powershell
.\shared\scripts\Start-SparseCloneUI.ps1
```

In the UI:

1. Set **Clone mode** to `Toolkit`.
2. Choose the target **Toolkit platform** such as `AzDo`, `GitHub`, or `GitLab`.
3. Keep **Toolkit profile** as `Standard` unless you only need minimal CI/CD assets.
4. Check **Include workshop material**.
5. Run the sparse clone.

When **Include workshop material** is selected, the cloned working directory includes this workshop catalog, sample data, delivery docs, architecture docs, FAQ/reference docs, presentations, and platform-specific files.

### Option 2 — Use the script directly

```powershell
.\shared\scripts\Clone-SparseToolkitProfile.ps1 `
  -RepoUrl <source-repo-url> `
  -Destination Fabric-AzDo-Workshop `
  -Platform AzDo `
  -IncludeWorkshop
```

Use `-Platform GitHub`, `-Platform GitLab`, or `-Platform All` for other delivery environments.

## Current workshops

| Workshop | Audience | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [Core Fabric Git Workshop](core-fabric-git/README.md) | BI developers, Fabric admins, DevOps engineers, BI leads | Teach Fabric workspace Git integration, PBIP source control, branching, PR flow, CI/CD validation, and deployment pipelines |
| [Accelerator Toolkit Workshop](accelerator-toolkit/README.md) | BI leads, report creators, semantic model owners, platform engineers, governance owners, release managers | Teach how to use the no-code accelerator tools to create standards, rules, policies, review evidence, pipeline config, release readiness, adoption metrics, and reference outputs |

**GCC High caveat:** **When a workshop targets GCC High, explain that PBIP remains the validated source, but deployment imports a checked-in PBIX through Power BI REST. The PBIP, PBIX, and `deployment-manifest.json` must be committed together.** See [GCC High deployment behavior](../architecture/gcc-high-deployment.md).

## Sample data

| [Measure Documentation Workshop](future/measure-documentation-workshop.md) | DAX measure catalog, dependencies, ownership, and certification support |
| [Report UX Review Workshop](future/report-ux-review-workshop.md) | Accessibility, navigation, layout, theme, tooltips, and mobile review |
| [Certification and Security Readiness Workshop](future/certification-security-readiness-workshop.md) | Certification evidence, sensitivity labels, PII checks, sharing restrictions, and endorsement |

| [Enterprise Rules Governance Workshop](future/enterprise-rules-governance-workshop.md) | Central baseline rules, override schema, exception lifecycle, and profile-based enforcement |

## Folder convention

Use this structure for each workshop:

```text
docs/workshops/<workshop-name>/
  README.md
  labs/
  reference-output/
  facilitator-notes/
```

Only add subfolders that are actually needed. Every workshop should include a `README.md` with audience, outcomes, prerequisites, agenda, and links to labs/reference outputs.

Sample data should live under:

```text
docs/workshops/sample-data/<scenario-name>/
  README.md
  data-dictionary.md
  pbip-build-guide.md
  csv/
```
