# Lab 2 Facilitator Change Log

## Purpose

Use this quick brief before Lab 2 so participants follow the current repository implementation and not older examples.

## What Changed

1. Lab 2 now points to the existing pipeline file at `azdo/azure-pipelines.yml`.
2. Lab 2 now teaches the current 5-stage flow: Validate -> Test -> Publish -> Deploy_Dev or Deploy_Feature.
3. References to legacy examples (`pbi-tools`, `pbip-lint`, and `SyncFabricDev`) were removed from Lab 2 materials.
4. Folder path examples were normalized to `/projects`.
5. Repository now excludes PBIP artifacts by design; participants bring their own PBIP locally.
6. Validation and deployment guidance now matches existing scripts and rule files:
   - `shared/tests/validate_pbip_structure.py`
   - `shared/tests/run_dax_tests.py`
   - `shared/scripts/Prepare-QualityRules.ps1`
   - `shared/scripts/deploy-dynamic.ps1`
   - `shared/Rules-Dataset.json`
   - `shared/Rules-Report.json`

## Facilitator Talk Track (2-3 minutes)

"For this workshop, we are not creating a new YAML pipeline from scratch. We are using the pipeline that already exists in the repo at azdo/azure-pipelines.yml. Your goal in Lab 2 is to register and run that pipeline, verify Validate, Test, Publish, and the branch-appropriate deploy stage, and enforce it as a required PR check on main."

## What Participants Should Actually Do

1. Select existing YAML file path: `/azdo/azure-pipelines.yml` when creating the pipeline.
2. Confirm stage sequence: Validate -> Test -> Publish -> Deploy_Dev or Deploy_Feature.
3. Review test output in the pipeline Tests tab.
4. Verify `pbip-drop` in the Artifacts tab.
5. Confirm deployment logs show `Fabric PBIP deployment completed.`
6. Add pipeline as required build validation on `main`.

## Common Questions and Answers

1. Q: "Why don't we install pbi-tools in this lab anymore?"
   A: "The workshop now mirrors the real pipeline implementation in this repo, which uses PBIP structure checks plus dataset/report quality rule execution."

2. Q: "Where are the Power BI project files expected by the pipeline?"
   A: "Participants add their own PBIP locally under `projects` or `shared/pbip-local`. The repo stores reusable assets only: tests, scripts, rules, and pipeline YAML."

3. Q: "Are we doing automatic workspace sync in Lab 2?"
   A: "Yes. The current pipeline deploys the validated PBIP artifact directly with `scripts/deploy-dynamic.ps1`: `main` and `develop` target Dev, while `feature/*` targets prefixed feature workspaces."
