### PBIP Diff Viewer

![PBIP Diff Viewer](images/tool-walkthrough/pbip-diff-viewer.png)

**What it does:** Compares two PBIP snapshots and translates raw JSON/TMDL changes into reviewer-friendly categories and guidance.

**Understanding Before and After Folders**

The tool requires two PBIP folder snapshots representing different points in time:

- **Before folder**: The original PBIP project state (e.g., from `main` branch or previous commit)
- **After folder**: The modified PBIP project state (e.g., from `feature/xyz` branch or after edits)

To obtain these folders:

1. **From Git branches** (recommended for review):
   - Checkout parent branch (e.g., `git checkout develop`) → export PBIP folder
   - Checkout feature branch (e.g., `git checkout feature/my-feature`) → export PBIP folder

2. **From workspace exports**:
   - Open Power BI Desktop → File → Export → save PBIP folder
   - Make changes to your report/model
   - Export again to create the "after" folder

**How to use it:**

1. Open `tools/pbip-diff-viewer/index.html`.
2. Click **Load before folder** and select the original PBIP snapshot.
3. Click **Load after folder** and select the modified PBIP snapshot.
4. Review added, removed, and changed report, semantic model, rule, DAX test, exception, manifest, and pipeline files.
5. Filter by artifact type or path and inspect the before/after excerpts.
6. Export HTML, Markdown, or JSON diff reports for PR review.

**Questions it answers:**

- Which report pages, visuals, semantic model files, and governance assets changed?
- What should reviewers focus on instead of reading raw PBIP JSON?
- Were files added or removed intentionally?
- Which JSON properties changed in metadata files?

**Productivity and governance value:** Gives reviewers a concise change lens before they inspect raw PBIP metadata or approve a pull request.

### Dependency Impact Analyzer

![Dependency Impact Analyzer](images/tool-walkthrough/dependency-impact-analyzer.png)

4. Review impacted measures, relationships, visuals, pages, tests, and governance assets.
5. Export HTML, Markdown, or JSON impact reports for PR and release review.

**Questions it answers:**

- Which measures reference a changed table, column, or measure?
- Which report pages and visuals may need regression review?
- Which relationships or governance files mention the changed object?
- What should reviewers test before approval or promotion?

**Productivity and governance value:** Focuses testing and review on likely downstream impact instead of asking reviewers to manually inspect every report and model file.

### Effective Rules Generator

![Effective Rules Generator](images/tool-walkthrough/effective-rules-generator.png)

**What it does:** Merges baseline rules, branch policy, rule overrides, and approved exceptions into effective CI rule files that the pipeline will enforce. Includes a **searchable rule picker** to define rule property changes (logType, threshold, disabled).

**How to use it:**

1. Open `tools/effective-rules-generator/index.html`.
2. Load `Rules-Report.json` and `Rules-Dataset.json` (baseline rules created by Enterprise Standards Builder).

   - Override `disabled` (temporarily disable a rule during release)
4. Optionally paste exception register JSON from Policy Exception Register.
5. Choose source and target branches to apply branch-aware logic.
6. Generate effective rule files and summary.
