# Complete Validation & Correction Summary

**Date:** 2026-07-24  
**Status:** ✅ ALL FIXES COMPLETED AND COMMITTED

---

## Summary of Work Completed

You requested three things to align the walkthrough instructions with actual tool behavior. All three are now complete:

1. ✅ **Made all fixes** to runbook files
2. ✅ **Created detailed recording script** with actual UI narration  
3. ✅ **Created visual reference guide** showing what you'll see

---

## What Was Wrong

The walkthrough instructions referenced controls and UI elements that **don't exist in the actual tools**. This would have caused major confusion during recording.

### Critical Discrepancies Found (and Fixed)

| Issue | What Instructions Said | What Actually Appears | Impact | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Control names | "Restrict old visual types" | "Keep reports concise and navigable" | 🔴 CRITICAL | ✅ FIXED |
| Control names | "Require naming convention for measures" | "Limit visible visuals per page" | 🔴 CRITICAL | ✅ FIXED |
| Control names | "Restrict deprecated functions" | "Prevent vertical page scrolling" | 🔴 CRITICAL | ✅ FIXED |
| UI element | "Three profile buttons" | Profile dropdown combobox | 🟡 HIGH | ✅ FIXED |
| Button names | "Generate Rules or Summary" | "Download report rules", "Download dataset rules", "Download summary" | 🟡 HIGH | ✅ FIXED |
| Tool count | "15 tools" | "16 tools" | 🟡 HIGH | ✅ FIXED |
| Workflow description | "Three workflows" | "16-step workflow sequence" | 🟡 HIGH | ✅ FIXED |

## What You'll See vs. What You'll Say

### Enterprise Standards Builder — Profile Selection

**WHAT YOU'LL SEE:**
```
Profile [dropdown ▼]
├─ Advisory adoption
├─ Enterprise standard ← Select this
├─ Strict enterprise gate
└─ Custom
```

**WHAT YOU'LL SAY:**
> "Look at the profile dropdown. You can choose from advisory adoption (permissive for onboarding), enterprise standard (balanced, most common), strict enterprise gate (high control), or custom. Let's select Enterprise standard."

### Enterprise Standards Builder — Policy Controls

**WHAT YOU'LL SEE (actual checkboxes):**
- ✅ Keep reports concise and navigable
- ✅ Limit visible visuals per page  
- ✅ Limit advanced filters per page
- ✅ Prevent vertical page scrolling
- ✅ Use enterprise theme colors
- ✅ Require chart axis titles
- ✅ Require meaningful page names
- ✅ Discourage report-level local measures
- ✅ Remove auto-date tables

**WHAT YOU'LL SAY:**
> "As I scroll through the policy controls, you see real enterprise standards: limiting page count, controlling visuals per page, enforcing theme colors, requiring meaningful page names, and keeping developers focused on shared measures instead of report-level local measures."

### Download Buttons

**WHAT YOU'LL SEE (actual buttons):**
```
[Download summary]
[Download report rules]
[Download dataset rules]
[Download policy profile]
```

**WHAT YOU'LL SAY:**
> "Now click Download summary to generate the policy documentation. Click Download report rules to export the report quality rules. Click Download dataset rules to export the semantic model rules. These three files go into your repo and become your governance."

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Part 1 — Step 1 (Launchpad) — Line 82-106

**BEFORE:**
```markdown
- **Tool Catalog tab** — List of all 15 tools
- **Workflow tab** — Three sequences: standards → review → release
...
> Notice there are three workflows: standards and quality foundation, 
> PBIP review and pull request readiness, and governance and adoption.
...
> You don't need to understand all 15 tools.
```

**AFTER:**
```markdown
- **Tool Catalog tab** — List of all 16 tools
- **Workflow tab** — 16-step recommended workflow sequence
...
> Notice the Workflow tab shows the complete 16-step recommended sequence. 
> Part 1 covers steps 1–3 (define standards, tune rules, and add DAX tests). 
> Part 2 covers steps 4–6 (deployment, readiness scanning, and change analysis). 
> Part 3 covers steps 7–16 (pipeline generation through adoption metrics).
...
> You don't need to understand all 16 tools.
```

### 2. Part 1 — Step 2 (Standards Builder) — Line 133-161

## What To Do Next

### Step 1: Review the Recording Script
Read through `RECORDING-SCRIPT-PART1-ACTUAL-UI.md` to familiarize yourself with the actual narration

### Step 2: Print the Quick Reference Guide
Print the quick reference card from `VISUAL-REFERENCE-GUIDE-PART1.md` and keep it on your desk

### Step 3: Test Recording Environment
- Browser at 100% zoom
- Window maximized to 1920x1080
- Server running on localhost:8000
- Tools loading without errors

### Step 4: Record Part 1
Use the recording script, not the old runbook. Reference the visual guide as needed.

### Step 5: Validate Audio
Listen to your recording and verify you said the correct control names and tool count

### Step 6: Move to Parts 2 & 3
Once Part 1 is validated, apply same verification process to Part 2 and Part 3 (I can help with those too)
