# Part 3 Runbook — Pipeline, Release, Governance, and Adoption

## Overview

**This is the third and final video in a three-part series.**

**Prerequisites:** To get the most from this video, you should watch [Part 1 — Standards and Quality Foundation](part-1-standards-quality.md) and [Part 2 — PBIP Review and PR Readiness](part-2-pbip-review.md) first. Part 1 established governance rules. Part 2 showed PR review workflow. Part 3 shows how platform teams automate all of this and measure success.

**What we assume you have:** By the start of Part 3, your organization should have:
- Quality rules committed to your repo (from Part 1)
- PR review workflows in place (from Part 2)
- One or more PBIP projects ready to deploy
- A choice of CI/CD platform (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI)

If you're watching standalone: this part still works. You'll understand platform-level governance and scaling, even without Parts 1 & 2.

## Goal

Show how the toolkit supports platform teams in generating CI/CD configuration, managing policy exceptions, tracking governance coverage, assessing release readiness, and measuring adoption across the organization.

This part is designed for:
- **Platform teams and DevOps engineers** who set up CI/CD pipelines and governance infrastructure
- **Release managers and BI leads** who coordinate deployments and manage exceptions
- **Governance owners and program officers** who track adoption and measure program success
- **Facilitators** delivering the accelerator at scale

## Recommended length

12–18 minutes (8 tools means more content; consider breaking into two shorter videos if needed).

**Note:** This part has more tools than Parts 1 & 2. If timing becomes tight, consider focusing on the first 5 tools (Pipeline Config through Release Readiness) and skipping or abbreviating the last 3 (Rule Coverage, Adoption, Differentiation) for a later video.

## What you'll create by the end of this part

By the end of Part 3, you'll have created:
- Platform-specific CI/CD YAML (azure-pipelines.yml, github-actions.yml, or gitlab-ci.yml)
- Exception tracking register (policy-exceptions.json)
- Effective rules files showing what CI actually enforces
- Release readiness assessment
- Adoption metrics and program reporting

These artifacts **enable governance at scale**: consistent enforcement across teams and platforms.

## Tools covered

1. **Pipeline Config Generator** — Generate platform-specific CI/CD YAML
2. **Policy Exception Register** — Track owned, approved, time-bound exceptions
3. **Effective Rules Generator** — Merge baseline rules, overrides, and exceptions
4. **CI/CD Platform Parity Matrix** — Document capability parity across platforms
5. **Release Readiness Dashboard** — Consolidate evidence for release decisions
6. **Adoption Metrics Dashboard** — Measure program success and maturity
7. **Rule Coverage Matrix** — Map policies to automated and manual checks
8. **Competitive Differentiation Matrix** — Position the solution against alternatives

## Key theme

"Scale what works." This part shows how to take a working governance and CI/CD model on one team and scale it to many teams and projects without reinventing anything.

## Recording setup

Start localhost:

```powershell
cd C:\Projects\Fabric-BI-DevOps-Demo
python -m http.server 8000
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/tools/index.html
```

## Opening narration

Say:

> Welcome to Part 3 of the Fabric BI DevOps Accelerator Toolkit walkthrough.

> If you've watched Parts 1 and 2, you know how to define governance and how to review pull requests. Great.

> But here's the next question: How do you scale this across your whole organization? How do you generate the same CI/CD pipeline for 20 different projects? How do you track exceptions? How do you know if the program is actually working?

> This part is about platform-level governance and sustainability. It's for the teams that build and maintain the infrastructure.

> We're going to show how to generate CI/CD configuration for multiple platforms, manage policy exceptions so they don't become permanent bypasses, track governance completeness, and measure adoption and program success.

> By the end, you'll understand how to take a working governance model on one team and scale it to dozens of teams without reinventing everything.

> Let's start.

**Timing:** 45 seconds. Sets context and emphasizes scale and measurement.

## Step 1 — Pipeline Config Generator

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/tools/pipeline-config-generator/index.html
```

Say:

> One of the big challenges in multi-platform environments is this: if you support Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI, do you write and maintain three separate pipeline definitions? That's a lot of work and creates drift.

> The Pipeline Config Generator takes one delivery profile—one set of decisions about what stages to run, what gates to enforce, what artifacts to publish—and generates platform-specific YAML for all three platforms.

Demo actions:

1. Click **Use starter example** to load a pre-built profile.

2. Show the profile configuration:
   - **Platform selector** (dropdown to choose Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI)
   - **Solution name and description**
   - **Pipeline stages** (lint, validate, publish, deploy, etc.)
   - **Enabled checks** (run quality rules? run DAX tests? require approvals?)
   - **Trigger settings** (run on main? run on PRs?)
   - **Publish targets** (where do artifacts go?)
   - **Deployment settings** (Dev/Test/Prod stages, parameters, approvals)

3. Select **Azure DevOps** from the Platform dropdown and click **Generate pipeline**.

4. Show the generated YAML for Azure DevOps. Pause for 2–3 seconds.

5. Switch to **GitHub Actions** in the Platform dropdown and click **Generate pipeline** again.

6. Show the generated YAML for GitHub Actions. Pause for 2–3 seconds.

7. Switch to **GitLab CI** in the Platform dropdown and click **Generate pipeline**.

8. Show the generated YAML for GitLab CI. Pause for 2–3 seconds.

9. Click the **Setup notes** tab to show the pipeline-setup-notes.md output.

Say:

> Notice how the logic is the same across all three platforms, but the syntax is different. The generator handles that translation. You write the spec once, and the YAML is generated for each platform.

> Can you customize the YAML after generation? Absolutely. But you start with a working, tested template that covers the common cases.

Artifacts to mention:

```text
azure-pipelines.generated.yml
powerbi-ci.generated.yml  (GitHub Actions)
gitlab-ci.generated.yml
pipeline-profile.json
pipeline-setup-notes.md
```

Use-case example:

> Example: Your organization standardizes on GitHub Actions, but one team uses Azure DevOps for legacy reasons. You use the Pipeline Config Generator to create one profile that works for both teams. Each team gets the YAML they need, and they're enforcing the same standards.

Transition:

> Once the pipeline is running, you need a way to manage exceptions. Not every team can follow every rule all the time.

**Timing:** 3–4 minutes.

## Step 2 — Policy Exception Register

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/tools/policy-exception-register/index.html
```

Say:

> In the real world, not every artifact can follow every rule all the time. Sometimes there's a business need that conflicts with a governance standard. When that happens, you need a way to approve, track, and eventually resolve the exception.

> The Policy Exception Register is your exception management system. It makes exceptions visible, owned, approved, mitigated, and time-bound.

> Without this tool, exceptions become invisible—they live in Slack messages, email threads, or pull request comments. They're never tracked and never resolved.

Demo actions:

1. Click **Use starter examples** to load pre-built exceptions.

2. Open an approved exception and show:
   - **Rule ID** (which governance rule is the exception for?)
   - **Affected artifact** (which report, dataset, or solution is affected?)
   - **Owner** (who requested the exception?)
   - **Approver** (who is responsible for approving it?)
   - **Reason** (why is the exception necessary? business context matters.)
   - **Mitigation** (what's the plan to get back to compliance?)
   - **Expiration date** (when must this be resolved or explicitly extended?)

3. Show the generated summary Markdown.

Say:

> Each exception is visible. If you want to know which rules have been bypassed and why, you read this register.

> Each exception has an owner and approver. Everyone knows who's responsible.

> Each exception expires. If an exception is still needed, it must be explicitly re-approved. If it expires without action, it becomes a CI blocker until someone reviews it.

Artifacts to mention:

```text
policy-exceptions.json
policy-exceptions-summary.md
```

Use-case example:

> Example: A legacy report has a naming convention that doesn't match new standards. It would take weeks to refactor it. The team files an exception: 'We need to keep the old naming on this report for backward compatibility. We'll rename it when we decommission it in Q2.' The exception is approved until Q2. When Q2 arrives, the team either removes the report, renames it, or requests another extension. The governance owner can see exactly what's exempted, why, and for how long.

Transition:

> Exceptions and branch policy affect what the CI system actually enforces. The Effective Rules Generator shows you exactly what that is.

**Timing:** 3–4 minutes.

## Step 3 — Effective Rules Generator

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/tools/effective-rules-generator/index.html
```

Say:

> Here's the complexity: you have baseline enterprise rules. You might have project-specific overrides. You might have approved exceptions. The CI/CD system needs to know: what am I actually enforcing on this branch, in this project, right now?

> The Effective Rules Generator answers that by merging all three sources—baseline, overrides, and exceptions—into a single set of rules that the pipeline uses.

Demo actions:

1. Click **Use starter example** to load a pre-configured scenario.

2. Show the inputs:
   - **Baseline rules** (enterprise-wide standards from Part 1)
   - **Project overrides** (customizations for this team or project)
   - **Approved exceptions** (temporary bypasses from the exception register)
   - **Source branch** (which branch are we coming from?)
   - **Target branch** (which branch are we merging into?)

3. Click **Generate Effective Rules**.

4. Show the output files:
   - Rules-Report.effective.json
   - Rules-Dataset.effective.json
   - effective-rules-summary.md

5. Pause on the summary for 2–3 seconds.

Say:

> This is the source of truth for enforcement. The CI/CD system reads this file and enforces exactly what's here. No guessing, no surprises.

Artifacts to mention:

```text
Rules-Report.effective.json
Rules-Dataset.effective.json
effective-rules-summary.md
```

Use-case example:

> Example: Your enterprise baseline has a 'strict' set of rules. The Sales team's project needs to be slightly more permissive during onboarding, so they have project overrides that lower severity on two rules for the dev branch. Plus, they have one approved exception. The Effective Rules Generator shows: on the dev branch, enforce these 18 rules strictly and these 2 with warnings. On main, enforce all 20 strictly. The CI system reads this and applies the right rules to the right branches.

Transition:

> Now you know what you're enforcing. But here's a question: are your governance rules applicable across all three CI/CD platforms equally?

**Timing:** 3–4 minutes.

## Step 4 — CI/CD Platform Parity Matrix

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/tools/platform-parity-matrix/index.html
```

Say:

> One of the core value propositions of this accelerator is that it's platform-neutral—you can use it with Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI. But let's be honest: there are differences across platforms.

> The CI/CD Platform Parity Matrix documents exactly what works the same, what requires workarounds, what's in progress, and what's not available yet.

> This is critical information for platform teams making deployment decisions.

Demo actions:

1. Click **Use starter matrix** to load the comparison.

2. Show the matrix with columns for:
   - Azure DevOps
   - GitHub Actions
   - GitLab CI

3. Point out the legend:
   - ✅ Supported (same across all platforms)
   - ⚠️ Partial (different implementations or limitations)
   - 🔄 Planned (coming soon)
   - ❌ Gap (not available or significant workaround needed)

4. Scroll through and explain 3–4 row examples (e.g., "branch policies", "PR comments", "artifact storage").

Say:

> This matrix answers the question: 'If I choose GitLab CI, what trade-offs am I making?' Teams can make informed platform decisions instead of discovering parity issues after they've already started.

Artifacts to mention:

```text
platform-parity-matrix.json
platform-parity-matrix.md
```

Transition:

> Okay, the platform is set up, exceptions are managed, rules are effective. The last big question is: are we ready to release?

**Timing:** 2–3 minutes.

## Step 5 — Release Readiness Dashboard

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/tools/release-readiness-dashboard/index.html
```

Say:

> Release decisions are often made on gut feel or hope. The Release Readiness Dashboard changes that by consolidating all the evidence—validation, quality, tests, manifest, exceptions, adoption metrics—into one recommendation.

Demo actions:

1. Click **Use starter example** to load a pre-built assessment.

2. Show:
   - **Overall readiness score** (percentage ready, as a number)
   - **Blockers** (failures that prevent release)
   - **Warnings** (concerns that should be reviewed before release)
   - **Evidence sources** (where did each signal come from? validation logs, quality rules, DAX tests, etc.)
   - **Recommendation** (Ready, Ready with Review, or Do Not Release)

3. Show how different signal types contribute to the score.

Say:

> A release manager reads this and sees: 'Quality checks passed 95%, DAX tests passed 100%, deployment manifest is complete, exceptions are managed, adoption metrics show similar projects succeed 90% of the time. Recommendation: Ready.'

> That's evidence-based decision-making.

Artifacts to mention:

```text
release-readiness-dashboard.html
release-readiness-summary.md
release-readiness-report.json
```

Transition:

> Releases happen. The question after that is: are we actually improving over time?

**Timing:** 2–3 minutes.

## Step 6 — Adoption Metrics Dashboard

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/tools/adoption-metrics-dashboard/index.html
```

Say:

> Governance programs are usually measured by compliance: 'Are people following the rules?' But that's backward-looking. The Adoption Metrics Dashboard is forward-looking: 'How many teams have we onboarded? How mature are they? Are they getting faster?'

> This is what program officers use to argue for continued investment.

Demo actions:

1. Click **Use starter metrics** to load pre-built metrics.

2. Show:
   - **Projects onboarded** (by platform, by team, by status)
   - **Readiness scores** (average, by project, distribution)
   - **Rule maturity** (how many rules are enabled? how many issues are they catching?)
   - **Exception aging** (are exceptions being resolved or extending indefinitely?)
   - **Time-to-onboard** (how long does it take a new team to be productive?)
   - **Velocity improvement** (are review times improving? are rework cycles decreasing?)

3. Show the generated CSV and Markdown.

Say:

> Example metrics: 'We've onboarded 40 projects. Average readiness is 82%. Exceptions are being resolved on-time. Time-to-onboard has decreased from 3 weeks to 2 weeks.' That's evidence of program success.

Artifacts to mention:

```text
adoption-metrics.json
adoption-metrics.csv
adoption-metrics.md
```

Transition:

> One more thing: when you define governance, you should track coverage. Are you governing everything you said you would?

**Timing:** 2–3 minutes.

## Step 7 — Rule Coverage Matrix

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/tools/rule-coverage-matrix/index.html
```

Say:

> The Rule Coverage Matrix maps your governance policies to implementation: which are automated rules, which are manual checks, and which are gaps you still need to fill.

> It's a completeness check on your governance program.

Demo actions:

1. Click **Use starter matrix** to load a pre-built coverage map.

2. Show columns like:
   - **Policy area** (data quality, naming standards, versioning, etc.)
   - **Automated rule** (is there a PBI Inspector or Tabular Editor rule?)
   - **Manual check** (do code reviewers verify this?)
   - **Owner** (who's responsible?)
   - **Status** (complete, partial, or planned?)

3. Point out a few rows that show complete coverage, partial coverage, and gaps.

Say:

> This matrix answers: 'Are we really governing everything we committed to?' It highlights gaps and helps prioritize which rules to automate next.

Artifacts to mention:

```text
rule-coverage-matrix.json
rule-coverage-matrix.md
```

Transition:

> Finally, let's talk about why this matters.

**Timing:** 2 minutes.

## Step 8 — Competitive Differentiation Matrix

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/tools/competitive-differentiation-matrix/index.html
```

Say:

> A lot of people ask: 'Is this just a pipeline? Or is it really something more?'

> The Competitive Differentiation Matrix answers that by comparing this accelerator to alternatives: generic CI/CD samples, best-practice decks, home-grown solutions, and public competitors.

Demo actions:

1. Click **Use starter matrix** to load the comparison.

2. Show rows for capabilities like:
   - PBIP-native understanding
   - Power BI/Fabric specific
   - No custom code required
   - Multi-platform support
   - Governance integration
   - Adoption tracking

3. Point out where this accelerator is differentiated and where alternatives are stronger (be honest).

Say:

> The point isn't that this is the only way. The point is that it's purpose-built for Power BI and Fabric, it doesn't require custom development, and it covers the full operating model from standards through adoption.

Artifacts to mention:

```text
competitive-differentiation-matrix.json
competitive-differentiation-matrix.md
```

**Timing:** 2–3 minutes.

## Closing narration

Say:

> Let's recap what we've covered across all three parts.

> **Part 1 — Standards Foundation:** You define quality policy once. You create rules, tune them for adoption phases, and document measure tests. These become the **governance foundation** that everything else depends on.

> **Part 2 — Review Workflow:** You show how report authors and reviewers use the toolkit to move from slow, confusion-filled reviews to fast, context-rich assessments. Authors check readiness before opening PRs. Reviewers understand changes in business terms, not JSON.

> **Part 3 — Platform & Scale:** You show how platform teams generate consistent CI/CD configuration across platforms, manage exceptions so they don't become permanent, track governance completeness, assess releases with evidence, and measure program success.

> Here's what makes this powerful: **These three pieces reinforce each other.**

> - Standards from Part 1 are automatically enforced by the CI/CD from Part 3.
> - Reviewers in Part 2 apply the standards from Part 1.
> - Exceptions tracked in Part 3 explain why Part 2 reviews sometimes approve deviations.
> - Adoption metrics in Part 3 show how many teams from Part 1 and Part 2 are successful.

> It's not just governance. It's not just CI/CD. It's an operating model.

> Teams can start small: one PBIP, one set of rules, one pipeline. Then they scale: more projects, more teams, more metrics. Every team enforces the same standards. Every reviewer has the same tools. Every release is evidence-based. Governance is visible, not hidden in Slack.

> That's the goal of this accelerator.

> Thank you for watching all three parts. We hope this helps you build a better, more measurable BI DevOps program.

> For more information, documentation, and sample artifacts, visit the GitHub repository. Good luck!

**Timing:** 3 minutes.

## Part-specific production tips

### For this part

- **This part is abstract.** Pipeline YAML, exception registers, and adoption metrics are less visual than Parts 1 & 2. Use use-cases to ground them in reality.
- **Emphasize patterns, not details.** Viewers don't need to understand every line of YAML. They need to understand: "The generator creates platform-specific files from one profile."
- **Show the exception register carefully.** The concept of 'time-bound exceptions' is important for governance credibility. Make sure viewers understand why this matters.
- **Platform Parity Matrix is validation.** This is where you back up the claim "it works with all three platforms." Show it clearly.
- **Adoption metrics close strong.** End with concrete numbers ("40 projects onboarded, average readiness 82%") to show program success.

### Recording order suggestion

1. Record opening narration (sets platform team perspective).
2. Record Pipeline Config Generator (most tangible tool).
3. Record Exception Register (foundation for flexibility).
4. Record Effective Rules (the enforcement transparency).
5. Record Platform Parity Matrix (proof of platform-neutrality).
6. Record Release Readiness (governance in action).
7. Record Adoption Metrics (program success).
8. Optional: Record Rule Coverage and Differentiation (these can be cut if time is tight).
9. Record closing narration.

### Timing breakdown (target: 15 minutes total)

- Opening: 1 min
- Pipeline Config: 3.5 min
- Exception Register: 2.5 min
- Effective Rules: 2.5 min
- Platform Parity: 1.5 min
- Release Readiness: 2 min
- Adoption Metrics: 2 min
- Optional (Rule Coverage + Differentiation): 3 min
- Closing: 2 min
- **Total: 18 min** (without optional: 15 min)
- **Edit to: 12–15 min** by trimming long pauses

### Length warning

This part has 8 tools. If your recording exceeds 15 minutes, consider:
1. **Speed up slightly** (130% playback speed is still clear).
2. **Cut optional tools** (Rule Coverage and Differentiation can go into a separate "advanced governance" video).
3. **Abbreviate tool explanations** (less detail on each tool, more focus on why it matters).
4. **Create two videos** (Pipeline + Exceptions + Effective Rules as "Part 3a"; Metrics + Coverage as "Part 3b").

### What viewers should know before watching

- **Watching after Parts 1 & 2:** This is the final piece. You've seen governance and review. Now you'll see how to automate and scale.
- **Watching standalone:** You can understand this part, but you'll get more value if you've seen Parts 1 & 2 first.
- **Series complete:** After this part, viewers have the full operating model: define → review → automate & scale.
