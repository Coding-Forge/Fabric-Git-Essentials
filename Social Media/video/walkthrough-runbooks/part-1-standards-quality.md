# Part 1 Runbook — Standards and Quality Foundation

## Overview

**This is the first video in a three-part series.**

Part 1 establishes the governance foundation that all other tools depend on. If you're watching this as a standalone video, you'll learn how to define quality standards. If you're watching the series, this part creates the governance rules that reviewers will use in Part 2 and that the CI/CD pipeline will enforce in Part 3.

## Goal

Show how the toolkit helps teams define BI quality standards without hand-editing JSON, tune individual rules for adoption flexibility, and create DAX test metadata that documents measure expectations before CI/CD enforcement.

This part is designed for:
- **BI leads and governance owners** who need to set baseline quality standards
- **Platform teams** who manage the quality rule infrastructure
- **Report creators and model owners** who want to understand what standards will apply to their work
- **Facilitators** delivering the accelerator to customers

## Recommended length

8–12 minutes (allows time for detailed explanations and use-case context).

## What you'll create by the end of this part

By the end of Part 1, you'll have created and committed:
- `Rules-Report.json` — Report quality rules
- `Rules-Dataset.json` — Semantic model quality rules
- `enterprise-policy-profile.json` — Your governance choices
- `dax-tests.json` — Measure test metadata
- `Policy-Summary.md` — Human-readable governance documentation

These files are the **governance foundation** that Parts 2 and 3 reference.

## Tools covered

1. **Launchpad** — Navigation and workflow orientation
2. **Enterprise Standards Builder** — Define baseline quality policy
3. **Quality Rule Designer** — Tune rules for adoption phases
4. **DAX Test Builder** — Document measure-level business expectations

## Key theme

"Define it once, enforce it everywhere." This part shows how to turn governance policy decisions into automated checks that the CI/CD pipeline enforces on every pull request, without requiring report creators to understand or maintain JSON files.

## Recording setup

Start the local server:

```powershell
cd C:\Projects\Fabric-BI-DevOps-Demo
python -m http.server 8000
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/tools/index.html
```

Verify all tools load without errors.

## Opening narration

Say:

> Welcome to Part 1 of the Fabric BI DevOps Accelerator Toolkit walkthrough. In this video, we're going to show how to define quality standards for your Power BI and Fabric environment.

> If you've ever had this problem—you have 50 reports across your organization and you want them all to follow the same visual standards, the same measure naming conventions, and the same semantic model quality rules—but you don't want to ask every report author to hand-edit JSON files—this part is for you.

> We're going to define a baseline quality policy using a guided UI, tune rules for your adoption strategy, and document measure-level tests. By the end of this part, you'll have a set of governance rules that your CI/CD system can enforce automatically.

> Let's start.

**Timing:** 45 seconds. Sets context and value proposition.

## Step 1 — Launchpad

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/tools/index.html
```

Show:

- **Tool Catalog tab** — List of all 16 tools
- **Workflow tab** — 16-step recommended workflow sequence
- **Artifacts tab** — What each tool generates
- **Audience paths tab** — Role-based navigation

Say:

> The launchpad is the front door to the entire toolkit. Instead of guessing which tool to use first, start here. You'll see how the tools fit together and which roles use which tools.

> Notice the Workflow tab shows the complete 16-step recommended sequence. Part 1 covers steps 1–3 (define standards, tune rules, and add DAX tests). Part 2 covers steps 4–6 (deployment, readiness scanning, and change analysis). Part 3 covers steps 7–16 (pipeline generation through adoption metrics). We're starting with standards because everything else depends on clear quality expectations.

Demo actions:

1. Click **Tool Catalog** and read 3–4 tool descriptions aloud to show variety and depth.
2. Click **Workflow** and point out the Standards path in red. Explain that it flows left-to-right: Launchpad → Standards Builder → Rule Designer → DAX Test Builder.
3. Click **Artifacts** and highlight that each tool outputs Markdown, JSON, or YAML that can be committed to your repo.
4. Click **Audience paths** and show that BI leads and governance owners start in the standards workflow.

Say:

> The launchpad prevents overwhelm. You don't need to understand all 16 tools. You need to understand which tools matter for your role, and which ones can wait.

Transition:

> Now let's dive into defining standards.

**Timing:** 2–3 minutes.

## Step 2 — Enterprise Standards Builder

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/tools/enterprise-standards-builder/index.html
```

Say:

> The Enterprise Standards Builder is where the magic starts. Think of this as a policy wizard. You're going to make decisions about quality standards—which visual types are allowed, how tables and measures should be named, how DAX should be written—and the tool translates those decisions into automated rules.

> Why is this important? Because if you hand people a JSON file and ask them to edit it, adoption stops. But if you guide them through a UI, they understand the choices and feel ownership.

> The builder comes with pre-configured profiles that represent different governance maturity levels. You can also create a custom profile for your specific needs.

Demo actions:

1. Point out the profile dropdown combobox (at the top of the left sidebar):
   - **Advisory adoption** (permissive, designed for onboarding teams that are new to governance)
   - **Enterprise standard** (balanced, the most common choice)
   - **Strict enterprise gate** (high control, for regulated environments)
   - **Custom** (for organizations with unique requirements)

2. Click to select **Enterprise standard** from the dropdown (best middle-ground for demonstration).

3. Scroll through the policy controls (shown as checkboxes) and explain 2–3 key ones:
   - "Keep reports concise and navigable": Why you'd want this (limits page count so users can find content quickly; helps with page load time)
   - "Limit visible visuals per page": Why it matters (keeps report pages readable and responsive on various screen sizes)
   - "Prevent vertical page scrolling": Why it's important (enforces a consistent scrollable canvas height and avoids hiding content)
   - "Require chart axis titles": Why it matters (makes charts self-documenting and easier to interpret)

4. Scroll down to see more semantic model and report authoring settings:
   - "Require meaningful page names"
   - "Use enterprise theme colors" (enforces brand consistency)
   - "Remove auto-date tables" (prevents duplicate date hierarchies in DAX)
   - "Discourage report-level local measures" (pushes developers toward shared semantic model measures)

5. Click the **Download summary** button to generate the policy summary Markdown.

6. Pause on the summary Markdown for 2–3 seconds so viewers can see the output.

7. Click **Download report rules** to show the report rules JSON that will be generated.

8. Click **Download dataset rules** to show the semantic model rules JSON.

Say:

> Notice what happened. You didn't write any rules yourself. You made policy decisions through a UI, and the tool automatically generated the JSON rules that the CI/CD system will enforce. You'll see three downloads: report rules, dataset rules, and a policy profile that documents your choices.

Artifacts to mention and pause on:

```text
Rules-Report.json    → Report rules, their severities, and enabled flags
Rules-Dataset.json   → Semantic model and DAX rules
enterprise-policy-profile.json  → Your choices, stored for reuse or sharing
Policy-Summary.md    → Human-readable summary of what you've enabled
```

Say:

> These files get committed to your repo. Every time a report creator opens a pull request, the CI/CD system reads these rules and runs validation. If a report violates a rule, the PR check fails and the reporter gets feedback on what to fix.

> The key insight: you define governance once, and it applies everywhere, automatically.

Use-case example:

> For example, imagine your organization is moving 30 legacy reports to Power BI. You're worried about quality inconsistency. So you use this tool to define standards, commit the rules, and configure the pipeline. From that point forward, every report must pass these checks before it can be reviewed. That's enforcement at scale without asking reviewers to be lint tools.

Transition:

> Sometimes, though, you need flexibility. Maybe a rule is too strict during the early adoption phase. That's where the Rule Designer comes in.

**Timing:** 3–4 minutes.

## Step 3 — Quality Rule Designer

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/tools/rule-designer/index.html
```

Say:

> The Quality Rule Designer is for the platform team or advanced admins who need to tune individual rules. Maybe you're rolling out governance in phases, or maybe you need to author a custom rule that's specific to your business.

> The designer is safe—you're not editing JSON by hand. You're using a guided interface to change rule properties.

Demo actions:

1. Click **Use starter examples** to load pre-built rules.

2. Select one report rule (e.g., a visual type restriction or naming convention rule).

3. Show and explain:
   - **Rule ID** (internal identifier, helps with tracking)
   - **Name and description** (what does this rule enforce?)
   - **Severity** (error = blocking, warning = advisory, info = informational)
   - **Enabled flag** (can turn rules on/off without deleting them)
   - **Logic** (the actual rule expression)

4. If you have time, show how to change the severity of one rule (e.g., from error to warning). Explain why you'd do this:
   - "During adoption phase, we set rules to warning. Existing reports don't break. After 6 months, we promote warnings to errors."

5. Show a dataset rule (semantic model side) to demonstrate variety.

6. Show the generated Rules-Report.json and Rules-Dataset.json files.

Say:

> This flexibility is critical for real-world adoption. Governance doesn't have to be all-or-nothing. You can start permissive and tighten over time as teams get comfortable.

> You can also disable noisy rules. If a rule is generating too many false positives and slowing down development, you can disable it, give the team time to remediate, and then re-enable it later.

Artifacts to mention:

```text
Rules-Report.json
Rules-Dataset.json
```

Use-case example:

> Example: Your team is on-boarding 50 reports. The Enterprise Standards Builder sets 20 rules to error. But one rule about table naming is creating too much churn. So the platform team uses the Rule Designer to set that rule to warning for the dev branch. On main, it stays error. This gives teams time to adapt without being blocked.

Transition:

> So far we've defined structural quality: visual standards, naming conventions, model structure. The last piece is business logic quality. That's where DAX tests come in.

**Timing:** 2–3 minutes.

## Step 4 — DAX Test Builder

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/tools/dax-test-builder/index.html
```

Say:

> So far we've defined structural quality: how reports should look, how models should be organized. But structure alone doesn't guarantee correctness.

> Imagine you have a measure called Revenue that's used in 20 reports and dashboards. Someone changes the formula. The structure might still be correct—the measure is still there, the relationships are intact—but the calculation is wrong. Nobody would catch that at pull request time.

> That's where DAX tests come in. These are essentially unit tests for measures. You define what a measure should calculate and what the acceptable result is. If someone changes the measure and breaks the calculation, the test fails and catches it.

> The DAX Test Builder makes it easy to define these tests without writing DAX code yourself.

Demo actions:

1. Click **Use starter examples** to load pre-built measure tests.

2. Select one test case and show:
   - **Measure name** (which measure is being tested?)
   - **Owner** (who wrote this test? who should maintain it?)
   - **Scenario description** (e.g., "Total sales for Q4 2024 with no filters")
   - **Expected result** (e.g., "$1.2M")
   - **Acceptable tolerance** (e.g., ±0.1%; allows for rounding)
   - **Severity** (blocking = PR fails if test fails, warning = just warn, info = informational)
   - **Tags** (e.g., "revenue", "forecast", "critical"; helps organize tests)

3. Show the generated Markdown catalog (dax-test-catalog.md) so viewers see what the output looks like.

4. Explain the enablement flag: these tests start disabled because measure names, expected values, and filter contexts must be customized for each semantic model.

Say:

> The tests are disabled by default because you need to adapt them to your specific data. Once you've confirmed they're correct and they're passing, you enable them. From that point on, the CI/CD system runs them on every PR and reports pass/fail.

Artifacts to mention and pause on:

```text
dax-tests.json
dax-test-catalog.md
```

Use-case example:

> Example: Your Financial Controller says, 'I need to know if revenue is ever calculated incorrectly.' So your semantic model owner uses the DAX Test Builder to define tests for the key revenue measures—total revenue, revenue by region, revenue by product. They enable those tests in the CI/CD pipeline. Now, any change to revenue measures automatically runs the test and verifies correctness before the PR is approved.

## Closing narration

Say:

> At this point, we have a complete quality foundation:
>
> 1. **Enterprise standards** — Policy decisions about how reports and models should be structured and written.
> 2. **Tuned rules** — The ability to adjust severity and toggle rules based on adoption phase.
> 3. **Measure tests** — Automated checks for calculation correctness.
>
> All three get committed to your repo and consumed by CI/CD. Every PR validates against all of them automatically.

> These files we just created—the Rules-Report.json, Rules-Dataset.json, and dax-tests.json—are the **foundation**. They're the guardrails that keep quality consistent.

> But what happens next? What happens when a report author prepares a pull request? How do reviewers understand what changed? That's what Part 2 is about.

> In Part 2, we'll show how these standards work in practice. We'll see how report authors scan for readiness, how reviewers understand changes without reading raw JSON, and how the toolkit makes pull requests faster and more accurate.

> Thank you for watching Part 1. If you want to continue, head to [Part 2 — PBIP Review and PR Readiness](part-2-pbip-review.md).

**Timing:** 2–3 minutes.

## Part-specific production tips

### For this part

- **Emphasize the policy angle.** This isn't about buttons; it's about decisions. Speak to the governance choices, not the UI.
- **Show the three profiles clearly.** These represent different maturity levels. Make sure viewers understand when to use each.
- **Pause on generated JSON/Markdown.** Viewers need to see what governance looks like when it's written down.
- **Use the use-case scenarios.** They help viewers understand why governance matters.
- **Don't gloss over DAX tests.** Many practitioners skip this, but it's critical for semantic model quality.

### Recording order suggestion

1. Record the opening narration first (it sets the tone).
2. Record the Launchpad section next (establishes context).
3. Record Standards Builder (most important).
4. Record Rule Designer (builds on Standards Builder).
5. Record DAX Test Builder last (some viewers may skip it, so put it last for easy edits).
6. Record closing narration.

### Timing breakdown (target: 10 minutes total)

- Opening: 1 min
- Launchpad: 2.5 min
- Standards Builder: 3 min
- Rule Designer: 2.5 min
- DAX Test Builder: 2.5 min
- Closing: 1 min
- **Total: 12 min** (edit to ~10 min by trimming long pauses)

### What viewers should know before watching

This video works standalone, but it's the first in a three-part series:
- **Watching alone:** You'll understand how to define governance in your organization.
- **As Part 1 of series:** Watch this, then [Part 2](part-2-pbip-review.md) to see governance in action, then [Part 3](part-3-release-governance.md) to scale it.
