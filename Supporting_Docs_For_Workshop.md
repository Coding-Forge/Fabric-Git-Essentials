## 2.6 Lab #2 — CI Pipeline & Workspace Sync for PBIP

Primary references:
- **Lab #2 Guide — CI Pipeline & Workspace Sync for PBIP**  
  Covers four pipeline stages and two workspace sync approaches:
  - PBIP schema validation with `pbi-tools`  
  - DAX unit tests with JUnit output  
  - Lint rules via `pbip-lint`  
  - Publishing `pbip-artifacts`  
  - **Approach A:** Manual sync via Fabric portal Source control panel (UI walkthrough with Mermaid flow)  
  - **Approach B:** Automated sync via Fabric REST API `updateFromGit` using a service principal and Key Vault  
- **`scripts/sync_fabric_workspace.py`**  
  Python script committed to the repo that authenticates as a service principal and calls the Fabric `updateFromGit` API with long-running operation polling.  
- **Azure DevOps Variable Group `fabric-cd-vars`**  
  Holds `FABRIC_TENANT_ID`, `FABRIC_CLIENT_ID`, `FABRIC_WORKSPACE_ID`, and the Key Vault-linked `FABRIC_CLIENT_SECRET`.  
- **AzureDevOps Deep Dive**  
  Shows integration with dashboards and test plans.
- **Microsoft Learn — CI/CD Tutorial**  
  Mirrors the steps of building a working PBIP validation pipeline.

Lab #2 Outcomes:
- Working 4-stage CI/CD pipeline (Validate → Test → Publish → SyncFabricDev)  
- PR branch policies enforced; CI is a required status check on `main`  
- PBIP validation occurs automatically on every push  
- Dev workspace syncs automatically after every merge to `main` (Approach B)  
- Participants can also sync manually via the Fabric portal Source control panel (Approach A)
