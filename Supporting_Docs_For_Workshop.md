## 2.2 Version Control in Fabric & PBIP; Git with ADO/GitHub

Key references:
- **PBIP Format Overview**  
  Explains the structure of `.pbip` (TMDL, JSON, YAML).
- **Git Integration in Fabric (Admin + UX)**  
  Covers enabling Git integration and setting repo/branch mappings.
- **Branching Strategy Guidance** — see [Branching Strategy](../docs/architecture/branching-strategy.md)  
  Concepts:
  - Trunk‑based dev  
  - Short-lived feature branches (`feature/<alias>-<task>`)  
  - **Branch-out strategy:** each feature branch paired with a dedicated personal or scoped Fabric workspace  
  - Personal workspace (`WS-Dev-<alias>`) connected to feature branch for full isolation  
  - Reviewer preview: connect to the PR's feature workspace to see live rendered reports  
  - Ephemeral workspaces — delete branch and workspace together after PR merges  
  - Never edit directly in the shared Dev workspace  
- **Microsoft Learn — Git Integration**  
  Baseline fundamentals for participants who are new to Git in Fabric.

These resources help attendees understand *why* Git matters, *how* Fabric synchronizes workspace items, and *why* the branch-out strategy is essential for safe parallel development in BI teams.

## 2.5 Deployment Strategy: Dev → Test → Prod

Materials:

  Provides the end‑to‑end CI/CD model for PBIP-based development.
- **Knowledge Transfer (Enterprise-Scale Dev) PDF**  
  Contains:
  - Real YAML examples

  - Deployment pipeline synchronization  
- **Microsoft Learn — Deployment Pipelines**  
  Covers:
  - Stages  
  - Workspace binding  
  - Selective deployment  
  - Automation via APIs

Key messages:
- Every push to `main`, `develop`, or `feature/*` triggers validation, testing, and artifact publication  
- `main` and `develop` runs deploy the validated PBIP artifact to the Dev workspace  
- `feature/*` runs create or update isolated feature workspaces using a configured workspace prefix  
- Environment-specific configs use Azure DevOps variables, variable groups, and service principal authentication  
- No manual promotion to production

## 2.6 Lab #2 — CI/CD Pipeline for the Power BI Project

Primary references:
- **Lab #2 Guide — CI/CD Pipeline for the Power BI Project**  
  Covers the current 5-stage Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline:
  - PBIP structure validation with `tests/validate_pbip_structure.py`  
  - Dataset and report quality rules using Tabular Editor, PBI Inspector, and `scripts/Prepare-QualityRules.ps1`  
  - DAX unit tests with JUnit output from `tests/run_dax_tests.py`  
  - Publishing `pbip-drop` as a pipeline artifact  
  - Deploying to Dev or feature workspaces with `scripts/deploy-dynamic.ps1`  
- **`azdo/azure-pipelines.yml`**  
  Source-of-truth pipeline YAML used by the workshop.  
- **Project rules and scripts**  
  `Rules-Dataset.json`, `Rules-Report.json`, `scripts/Prepare-QualityRules.ps1`, and `scripts/deploy-dynamic.ps1` drive branch-aware quality checks and workspace deployment.  
- **AzureDevOps Deep Dive**  
  Shows integration with dashboards and test plans.
- **Microsoft Learn — CI/CD Tutorial**  
  Mirrors the steps of building a working PBIP validation and deployment pipeline.

Lab #2 Outcomes:
- Working 5-stage CI/CD pipeline (Validate → Test → Publish → Deploy Dev or Feature)  
- PR branch policies enforced; the CI/CD pipeline is a required status check on `main`  
- PBIP validation, testing, artifact publication, and workspace deployment occur automatically on configured branches  
- Participants use the same pipeline and project files found in the `projects` folder

# 3. Best Practices Summary

### Governance
- Enforce workspace separation  
- Require PR-based development  
- Centralize RLS/CLS rules  
- Standardize naming conventions  

### Git Integration
- Keep branches small  
- Protect `main`  
- Use Workspace → Git sync workflows  

### CI/CD
- Automate schema validation  
- Publish validated PBIP artifacts from the YAML pipeline  
- Deploy `main` and `develop` to Dev, and `feature/*` branches to isolated feature workspaces  
- Treat PBIP artifacts as code
