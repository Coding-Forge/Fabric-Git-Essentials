# Deployment Strategy
## Dev → Test → Prod

`13:00 – 13:45`

---

## Two Complementary Pipeline Systems

| System | Purpose | Trigger |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline** | Validate, test, publish, and deploy PBIP artifacts | Every configured branch push / PR |
| **Fabric Deployment Pipeline** | Promote workspace content across environments | Manual (with approval) or automated |

They work together:
- **CI/CD ensures quality** before deployment and before anything merges to `main`
- **Deployment Pipeline ensures consistency** when content moves to Test or Prod

---

## End-to-End Flow

```
Developer → feature branch → PR → CI/CD ✅ → merge to main
  ↓                                      ↓
Feature Workspace                     Dev Workspace deployment
                                              ↓
                              Fabric Deployment Pipeline: Dev → Test
                                              ↓
                                     UAT + Approval Gate
                                              ↓
                              Fabric Deployment Pipeline: Test → Prod
                                              ↓
                                       Prod Workspace ✅
```

## Azure DevOps Pipeline — 5 Stages

| Stage | Trigger | What It Does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Validate** | Every push / PR | PBIP structure + dataset/report quality checks |
| **Test** | After Validate | DAX unit tests → JUnit XML |
| **Publish** | After Test | Upload `pbip-drop` to ADO |
| **Deploy_Dev** | `main` / `develop` | Deploy to Dev with `deploy-dynamic.ps1` |
| **Deploy_Feature** | `feature/*` | Create/update feature workspace |

Validation, tests, and publishing must be **green** before any workspace deployment happens.

**GCC High caveat:** **Commercial Fabric deploys PBIP definitions. GCC High validates PBIP but deploys a checked-in PBIX through the Power BI REST `imports` API. The PBIP, PBIX, and `deployment-manifest.json` must be committed together.**

## CI Pipeline YAML — Key Structure

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include: [main, develop, feature/*]

variables:
  - group: pbip-shared-secrets
  - name: PBIP_PATH
    value: '.'
  - name: DEPLOY_SCRIPT_PATH
    value: 'scripts/deploy-dynamic.ps1'

stages:
  - stage: Validate
    jobs:
      - job: ValidatePBIP
        steps:
          - script: python tests/validate_pbip_structure.py --pbip-path "$(PBIP_PATH)"
      - job: Build_Datasets
      - job: Build_Reports

  - stage: Test
    dependsOn: Validate
    jobs:
      - job: DaxTests
        steps:
          - script: python tests/run_dax_tests.py --model-path "$(PBIP_PATH)"

  - stage: Publish
    dependsOn: Test
    jobs:
      - job: PublishArtifacts
        steps:
          - task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
            inputs:
              targetPath: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/$(PBIP_PATH)'
              artifact: 'pbip-drop'

  - stage: Deploy_Dev
    condition: main or develop branch

  - stage: Deploy_Feature
    condition: feature branch
```

---

## Automated Workspace Deployment

1. Publish creates `pbip-drop`
2. Deploy stage downloads the artifact
3. `scripts/deploy-dynamic.ps1` authenticates with a service principal
4. Commercial Fabric: semantic model deploys first, then report definitions are updated
5. GCC High: manifest is validated, then PBIX is imported with Power BI REST

Good for: repeatable Dev deployments and isolated feature branch validation.

---

## Workspace Sync in This Workshop

- `main` and `develop` deploy to the shared Dev workspace
- `feature/*` deploys to a prefixed feature workspace
- Test and Prod still receive content through Fabric Deployment Pipelines

---

## Fabric Deployment Pipelines

A **Fabric-native** feature (separate from Azure DevOps) that promotes workspace content between environments without re-publishing manually.

```
[Development]  →  [Test]  →  [Production]
 Promote ↗          Promote ↗
   (+ rules)           (+ approval)
```

**What it does at promotion time:**
- Copies reports, semantic models, dataflows, notebooks from one workspace to the next
- Applies **deployment rules** to swap data source connections per environment
- Shows a **diff view** so you know exactly what will change

---

## Deployment Rules — Why They Matter

Same PBIP artifact, different database per environment:

| Parameter | Dev | Test | Prod |
|-----------|-----|------|------|
| `ServerName` | `dev-sql.database.windows.net` | `test-sql.database.windows.net` | `prod-sql.database.windows.net` |
| `DatabaseName` | `SalesDB_Dev` | `SalesDB_Test` | `SalesDB_Prod` |

Deployment rules apply these overrides automatically at promotion time.
**No manual connection editing. No risk of accidentally pointing Prod at Dev data.**

---

## Validation Gates — Dev → Test

Before triggering the Dev → Test promotion:

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline green on `main` — Validate, Test, Publish, and Deploy_Dev passed
- [ ] JUnit: 0 test failures
- [ ] Dev workspace refresh succeeded
- [ ] Deployment rules configured for the Test environment

---

## Validation Gates — Test → Prod

Before triggering the Test → Prod promotion:

- [ ] UAT complete — stakeholder sign-off
- [ ] RLS roles tested with representative user accounts
- [ ] Refresh succeeded against Test database
- [ ] Schema diff reviewed — no unexpected changes
- [ ] **Manual approval** from BI Lead received

---

## What Gets Promoted by the Deployment Pipeline

| Item | Promoted? |
|------|-----------|
| Reports | ✅ |
| Semantic Models | ✅ |
| Notebooks | ✅ |
| Dataflows Gen2 | ✅ |
| Data Pipelines | ✅ |
| Lakehouses | ⚠️ Schema only |
| Warehouses | ⚠️ Schema only |
| Gateway connections | ✅ (via deployment rules) |

> 💡 Use **selective deployment** to promote only the items that changed — faster and safer for hotfixes.

---

## Key Principles

1. **`main` is always deployable** — CI/CD enforces this
2. **Dev is the only Git-connected workspace** — Test and Prod are promoted-only
3. **No manual prod deployments** — Deployment Pipeline only
4. **Secrets stay in secured variable groups or Key Vault** — never in pipeline YAML or PBIP files
5. **Every promotion is logged** — Deployment Pipeline audit trail + ADO build history
