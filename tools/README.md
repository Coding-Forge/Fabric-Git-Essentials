# Fabric BI DevOps Accelerator Tools

This folder contains static browser-based tools for creating and maintaining enterprise Power BI quality standards without hand-editing JSON.

## Launchpad

Open [Fabric BI DevOps Accelerator Launchpad](index.html) first. It provides the recommended workflow, audience paths, generated artifact summary, and links to every tool.

### DAX Test Builder

The DAX Test Builder creates test metadata for measure-level validation. It exports `dax-tests.json`, which the pipeline runner now reads for metadata validation and JUnit reporting. Actual DAX query execution can be added later through semantic-link-labs, XMLA, or Tabular Editor scripting.

A starter catalog of generally accepted DAX test patterns is available at `shared/dax-tests.json`. The starter tests are disabled by default because measure names, table names, expected values, and filter contexts must be customized for each semantic model before CI enforcement.

## Recommended Workflow

1. Open `tools/enterprise-standards-builder/index.html` in a browser.
2. Choose a profile: **Advisory adoption**, **Enterprise standard**, or **Strict enterprise gate**.
3. Adjust policy controls for report usability, visual standards, semantic model quality, DAX standards, and formatting.
4. Download the generated `Rules-Report.json` and `Rules-Dataset.json`.
5. Review the JSON and commit the files under `shared/`.
6. Use `tools/rule-designer/index.html` when you need to tune an individual rule or author custom PBI Inspector / Tabular Editor BPA logic.
7. Use `tools/dax-test-builder/index.html` to customize `shared/dax-tests.json`, define measure-level DAX tests, and export the updated test catalog.
8. Use `tools/deployment-manifest-builder/index.html` to create the deployment contract for Dev/Test/Prod, parameters, approvals, and rollback.
9. Use `tools/pbip-readiness-scanner/index.html` before opening a PR to catch missing PBIP structure, governance assets, and CI/CD wiring.
10. Use `tools/pbip-diff-viewer/index.html` to compare before/after PBIP snapshots in reviewer-friendly terms.
11. Use `tools/dependency-impact-analyzer/index.html` to trace changed semantic model objects to impacted measures, visuals, pages, relationships, tests, and governance assets.
12. Use `tools/pipeline-config-generator/index.html` to generate CI/CD YAML for Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI from one profile.
   - **GCC High caveat:** **GCC High validates PBIP but deploys a checked-in PBIX with Power BI REST `imports`; commit PBIP, PBIX, and `deployment-manifest.json` together.**
13. Use `tools/pr-quality-summary-generator/index.html` to create a reviewer-friendly PR summary from changed files and validation output.
14. Use `tools/policy-exception-register/index.html` when a rule or policy exception needs owner, reason, approval, expiration, and mitigation tracking.
15. Use `tools/effective-rules-generator/index.html` or `shared/scripts/New-EffectiveQualityRules.ps1` to produce effective CI rule files from baseline rules, overrides, and exceptions.
16. Use `tools/platform-parity-matrix/index.html` to compare platform capabilities and identify parity gaps.
17. Use `tools/release-readiness-dashboard/index.html` to consolidate evidence and make a release recommendation.
18. Use `tools/adoption-metrics-dashboard/index.html` to track adoption, platform usage, readiness scores, and onboarding metrics.
19. Use `tools/rule-coverage-matrix/index.html` to connect governance policies to automated rules and manual checks.
20. Use `tools/competitive-differentiation-matrix/index.html` to compare solution maturity and positioning against alternatives.

All tools are self-contained HTML files. They do not require a local server, package install, or internet access.
